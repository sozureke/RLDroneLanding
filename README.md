# ðŸ›¬ RLDroneLanding

**RLDroneLanding** is a research project aimed at teaching an autonomous drone to land safely on a moving platform using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.  
The goal of the project is to create a simulation environment, train the agent in PyBullet, and then transfer the model to the more realistic AirSim environment with the possibility of further transfer to a real drone.
